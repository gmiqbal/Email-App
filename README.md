# Email App in Java

This is an Email App built using Java programming language. The app creates a company email for new joiners and generates a unique password for each new email account. The app also sets the maximum storage capacity for each email account.


## How to Use

To use the app, you need to enter the new employee's details such as first name, last name, and department. The app will then generate a company email for the new employee with a unique password and set the maximum storage capacity for the email account.

The email address will be in the format: `firstname.lastname@department.company.com`. The password will be randomly generated and displayed on the console. The maximum storage capacity for the email account will be set to 500MB.
